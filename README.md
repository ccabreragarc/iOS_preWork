# iOS Intermediate Development: Introduce Yourself App

Welcome to the **Introduce Yourself App**, a project for the iOS Intermediate Development course. This app is designed to help you learn the basics of navigating Xcode and Swift by allowing users to introduce themselves through various inputs. By the end of this project, you'll understand how storyboards and logic work together to create a functional app.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to enter their first name, last name, and school name using text fields.
- **Academic Year Selection**: Users can choose their academic year via a segmented control.
- **Number of Pets**: Users can indicate the number of pets they own using a label and stepper.
- **More Pets Option**: A switch allows users to specify if they want more pets.
- **School Logo**: Displays an image of the user's school logo.
- **Introduction Button**: A button generates a personalized introduction based on the user's inputs.
- **Alert Presentation**: Displays an alert with the introduction message when the "Introduce Self" button is tapped.

## How to Get Started

1. **Setup Xcode**: Download and install Xcode from the Mac App Store.
2. **Familiarize with Swift**: Learn Swift basics using resources like Apple's Official Swift Guide and CodePath's Swift tutorials.
3. **Build the App**:
   - Create a new Xcode project with the "Storyboard" interface and "Swift" as the language.
   - Design the UI in the storyboard by adding labels, text fields, segmented control, switch, stepper, button, and an image view.
   - Connect these UI elements to your `ViewController.swift` file using IBOutlets and IBActions.
   - Implement logic to handle user interactions and present an introduction using an alert.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the UI with different fonts, colors, and backgrounds.
- Implement persistence to save user data across app sessions.
- Add more fields to create a more comprehensive user introduction.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations on completing your first iOS app! Keep experimenting with new features and improvements to deepen your understanding of iOS development.
